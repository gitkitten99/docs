# Claude

<Callout type="info" emoji="🛡️" title="Big picture">
Claude 3 follows a written “constitution” of principles to keep its answers useful and respectful. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
</Callout>

## Model trio

| Variant | Vibe | Best for |
| ------- | ---- | -------- |
| **Haiku** | Fast & light | Real-time chat, autocomplete :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} |
| **Sonnet** | Balanced | General daily tasks |
| **Opus** | Deep thinker | Long, nuanced answers |

All share a 200k-token context, with even larger windows in closed beta. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

## Handy things to try

- Ask it to “rewrite this paragraph to sound kinder.”  
- Upload a research PDF and say, “Highlight the three biggest caveats.”  
- Use its citation mode to see where info came from.

*Claude is famously careful, but it can still miss the mark—always sanity-check legal or medical advice.*
