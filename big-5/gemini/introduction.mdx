# Gemini

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸŒ " title="Headline feature">
Gemini 1.5 Pro can read an entire novelâ€”or your codebaseâ€”in one go, thanks to its million-token memory. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
</Callout>

## Why itâ€™s interesting

- **Long reads welcome** â€“ Upload huge PDFs, videos, or 700k-word docs and ask a question about any detail. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Two flavors** â€“ Pro handles deep reasoning; Flash (and the brand-new Flash-Lite) is tuned for speed and lower cost. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Built-in Google magic** â€“ It plugs straight into Gmail, Docs, Maps, and YouTube extensions.

## Everyday uses

- Summarize a 100-page contract.  
- Analyse a whole sprintâ€™s worth of code diffs.  
- Brainstorm YouTube titles by feeding it your rough script.

## Quick price sense

Geminiâ€™s pay-as-you-go starts at fractions of a cent per 1k tokens, and the first 100k tokens each month are free on Pro. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
