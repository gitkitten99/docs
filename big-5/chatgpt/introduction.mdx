# ChatGPT

<Callout type="info" emoji="💬" title="In one sentence">
ChatGPT is basically a super-well-read friend who can riff on almost any topic, day or night.  
</Callout>

## Why people like it

- **Responsive & Multimodal** – The latest GPT-4o version can look at pictures, listen to audio, and reply in real time. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Available everywhere** – There’s a free tier, a Plus plan (~$20 USD/month), and even enterprise bundles for teams. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Great for “blank-page” moments** – Whether you need an outline, a first draft, or quick code hints, it jumps-starts the process.

## What you can do with it

1. **Ask & learn** – “Explain quantum tunneling like I’m 12.”  
2. **Draft & tweak** – “Give me three newsletter headline ideas.”  
3. **Code & debug** – “Why is my Python loop so slow?”  

*(Yes, it sometimes makes stuff up—double-check important facts.)*

## Good to know

> ChatGPT’s knowledge is current through April 2025, so it may not know about last night’s sports scores—unless you enable browsing.
