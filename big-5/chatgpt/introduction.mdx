# ChatGPT

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡" title="TL;DR">
ChatGPT is a conversational wrapper around OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 models.  
Think of it as a **universal text assistant**: Q&A, content drafting, coding help, or brainstormingâ€”on demand.
</Callout>

## Key Capabilities

| Feature                  | What it means                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Natural-language chat    | Context-aware dialogueâ€”remembers prior turns in a session.       |
| Multimodal (GPT-4o)      | Accepts text, images, or voice and can respond in kind.          |
| Tool calling             | Can trigger custom functions / actions you expose via the API.   |
| Code interpreter         | Sandbox for data analysis, Python execution, and file upload.    |

## How It Works

When you send a prompt:

1. The LLM **tokenizes** your text.  
2. It predicts the *next* token, one after another, guided by parameters such as `temperature` and `top_p`.  
3. The streaming response is returned to you in real time.

```bash title="Curl example"
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [{"role": "user","content": "Explain RAG in 2 sentences."}],
    "temperature": 0.7
  }'
