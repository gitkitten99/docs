# Perplexity

<Callout type="info" emoji="🔗" title="Key twist">
Every reply comes with live web citations you can click—so you’re never left wondering, “Where did that fact come from?” :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
</Callout>

## Cool modes

- **Copilot** – A guided Q&A that builds research threads step by step.  
- **Quick** – A lightweight Mix-7B model for on-the-go searches. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

## Neat examples

1. Ask a broad question, skim the blue citation bubbles, then drill deeper.  
2. Paste a URL and say, “Summarize the key takeaways in plain English.”  
3. Use the mobile app’s “Quick” mode for a fast fact-check. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

**Heads-up:** Perplexity’s API is still invite-only, so integrations are limited for now.
